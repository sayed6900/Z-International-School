                <p>Arabic language starts right from Play Group, so that the children are able to practice it by the time they reach the higher grades. This is considered a key to unite the Muslims all over the world and to understand the Book of Allah in the language it was revealed in. The Elementary students use specially designed Arabic workbooks, developed in-house, which help the children build Arabic vocabulary quickly and practice Arabic letters.</p>
